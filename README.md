**Description :** Welcome onboard, I am excited to introduce my latest python project. The main objective of this project was to address several important questions related to the dataset:<br>
1.the regional sales in the best performing country<br>
2.the relationship between annual leave taken and bonus<br>
3.the relationship between country and revenue<br>
4.the relationship between sick leave and job title<br> 
5.the relationship between store trading duration and revenue, and the relationship between the size of stores, the number of employees, and revenue.<br>

The analysis aimed to identify key patterns and relationships that can help inform business decisions and improve overall performance. <br>
