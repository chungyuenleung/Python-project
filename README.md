**Description :** Welcome onboard, I am excited to introduce my latest python and Power BI project.In the python part of this project, the following step is taken to get a better understanding of customer satisfaction from the review and score they left after persuading:<br>
1.translate the review to English, use panda to import csv file.<br>
2.Use vadar to conduct sentiment analysis with threshold(neg': -0.65, 'neu': 0.00, 'pos': 0.56)<br>
3.Based on the polarity score, define and categorized review<br>
4.Use wordcloud to extract the key word from positive, neutral & negative review with Power BI<br> 

The sentiment analysis aimed to identify common words on each type of review, which can help identify root cause of unsatisfaction, inform business decisions and improve customer satisfaction. <br>
